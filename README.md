# Data files for Software Carpentry Epi R lessons at FMV

This repository is for teaching at the FMV (GREZOSP) workshop. Students should
clone the repo by running:

	git clone git@github.com:dhaine/swc-epi-r.git

To help with issues navigating to the correct working directory, it also
contains an RStudio project file. Thus students have the choice of either
navigating to the files from the Shell or the filesystem navigator on their OS.
